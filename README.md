# Getting started with EventSauce

This repository accompanies a [tutorial](https://tech.osteel.me/posts/building-a-php-cli-tool-using-ddd-and-event-sourcing-getting-started-with-eventsauce) on how to get started with [EventSauce](https://eventsauce.io) in a [Laravel](https://laravel.com) application. EventSauce is an [Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) library for PHP.

The tutorial is also part of a wider [series](https://tech.osteel.me/posts/building-a-php-cli-tool-using-ddd-and-event-sourcing-why) about building a complex PHP application for the console using a Domain-Driven Development approach.

This branch is the end result of the tutorial – the starting point can be found in the [start](https://github.com/osteel/eventsauce-tutorial) branch.
